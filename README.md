# Convolutional-Codes
Project is on the software implementation and performance analysis of the convolution coding scheme. Simulation was done in the following way: output of convolutional encoder was passed through the BSC, BEC and the Gaussian channels, and for each channel, the received sequence was decoded using a convolutional decoding algorithm.
