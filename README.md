# Convolutional-Codes, March 2020 | Kathan Sanghavi

I won Gold Medal for this project in CT111 course conducted in second sem by Prof. Yash Vasavada. I completed all parts of project: Basic, Intermediate, Advanced - A and Advanced - B in Matlab and also in Python - Spyder.

Project is on the software implementation and performance analysis of the convolution coding scheme. Simulation was done in the following way: output of convolutional encoder was passed through the BSC, BEC and the Gaussian channels, and for each channel, the received sequence was decoded using a convolutional decoding algorithm.
